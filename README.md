# bachelor-thesis-NTNU
A Latex template, class file, and examples for writing a bachelor thesis at NTNU

You should **fork** the COPCSE repo so that you have your own files to edit.

You should not change anything in the ntnuthesis folder.  That contains the structure and style information.

You should edit the files in the inc\ folder.  You can also add files in the images\ folder.  The BachelorThesis.tex file should also be changed to include any other folders. 

If you are using [**sharelatex**](http://www.sharelatex.com) then you should use the **New Project** -> **Import from GitHUB** that way you will have the repository in both sharelatex and on your own version on github.
